                    <p>Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time outdoors. I love to climb mountains. enjoy the beauty of nature, which can give my life peace.</p>
                    <p>My daily activities are lectures at Amik Hass and I use part of my time to learn self-taught in exploring programming languages. On Sundays and holidays I use to relax my brain by going out looking for fresh air in beautiful nature.</p>
